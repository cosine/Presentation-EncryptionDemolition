This project containts the presentation materials for my November 14,
2012 talk at Software Craftsmanship McHenry County.

If you are doing the lab exercises, you can use the pre-generated
EncDemoLab-1.zip file provided (do not look at EncDemoLab-1-answers.zip)
or generate a lab pack yourself:

(1) Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/cosine/Presentation-EncryptionDemolition.git
(2) Run create_lab_pack:  ruby create_lab_pack.rb EncDemoLab 1 1
